# LCPT dipole

This code provides a library that can be used to evaluate dipole amplitude computed using light cone perturbation theory, as a function of dipole size r (unit: GeV^(-1)), impact parameter b (unit: GeV^(-1)), and the angle between r and b. 

Note that the calculation is only valid in the perturbative small-r and small-b region. Consequently results at non-perturbatively large r and b are not included in the grids.

## Build

The code can be built using `cmake` (needs GSL)

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

This generates a static library `build/dipole/liblcptdipole.a` which can be linked to an another C++ project. The necessary datafiles can be found from the `data` directory. The filename shows the corresponding Bjorken-`x`, strong coupling constant `as` and infrared regulator `m` (in GeV). 

## How to use

See `src/example.cpp` as an example on how to use the library. The attached `dipole_amplitude.ipynb` Jupyter notebook can also be used to study the dipole amplitudes.
